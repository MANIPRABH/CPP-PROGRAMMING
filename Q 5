#include<bits/stdc++.h>
int main ()
{
 int a = 15, b = 20;
 printf("max = %d\n", ((a + b) + abs(a - b)) / 2);
 printf("min = %d", ((a + b) - abs(a - b)) / 2);
 return 0;
}
Ans:
 The header file <bits/stdc++. H> is not a standard header file of the
GNU C++ library; if we try to use it in other compilers, it might fail. Hence
it is also not a portable header, and therefore we should avoid using it.
